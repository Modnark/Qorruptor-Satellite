# Qorruptor-Satellite
QT-Based corruption client

# Features
Currently only supports the 86-box fork created by me and my friend NT_x86.

You can choose a range of bytes to corrupt

# Credits
NT_x86 helped a ton with low level stuff and other really cool features, lots of credit goes to them.

# Building
I built this on Linux with QT Creator, it does build on Windows using QT Creator as well. A proper build guide will probably be made some time in the future. I will try to keep up each release and provide binaries.
