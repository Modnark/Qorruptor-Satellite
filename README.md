# Qorruptor-Satellite
QT-Based corruption client

# Features
Currently only supports the 86-box fork created by me and my friend NT_x86.

# Credits
NT_x86 helped a ton with low level stuff and other really cool features, lots of credit goes to them.

# Building
I need to test this for myself, but `cmake --build ./` should work.
Alternatively, you can just use Qt Creator.
